  body: 'To the new librarian,


    Did you plant the seeds I gave you? Did you
    remember to water them? They''ll shrivel up if you don''t. I''ve sent you two
    more, just in case. That''s all I have, though, so be careful. If you write to
    me what you need and send me drobles, I''ll ship you more supplies. Oh - here''s
    20 drobles, also.


    ... Let''s talk more later.'
