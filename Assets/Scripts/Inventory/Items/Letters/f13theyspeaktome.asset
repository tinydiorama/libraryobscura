  body: 'This book speaks to me. As strange as it is to write, as soon as I had it
    in my hands, I began to hear whispers. They started almost like the rustling
    wind and grew into small, persistent tendrils of thought.


    I tried to read
    it from beginning to end. Last night, all I dreamt about was the book and shadows.


    Reverently,

    A
    Friend'
