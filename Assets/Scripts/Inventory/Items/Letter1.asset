    I send you an appeal - the shadows run deep
    outside. Where you stand on those hallowed grounds grow miraculous plants. Take
    these seeds to the garden, care for them, and return the grown plants to me.
    I can''t promise anything in return. Don''t try to leave there: you''re fate-bound
    now. I wouldn''t trade spots with you, but at least the Shades can''t reach you
    there.


    Sincerely,

    X'
