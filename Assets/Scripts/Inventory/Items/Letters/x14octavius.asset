  body: 'The Church is ablaze with rumors! Dozens of priests have now left with the
    two exiled Vicars. But it doesn''t matter -  the people have been mollified by
    the silly Sanctity ritual. Octavius has announced that the Church''s Seat would
    now be on the same grounds as the Infirmary. He said, "Faith is ever our shield."


    It
    seems I was wrong to hope. The Church is stronger than ever. All I can do now
    is work. What else can be done? The plague still sweeps the city.


    Faithlessly,

    X'
