    Today it felt like I buried the last of my hope in
    the cold ground. Whenever I eat or drink, I taste ash from the plague fires.
    I am hollow - stuck in an endless loop.


    Never before have we experienced
    terrors this great. Yet the work continues: we must keep the Shades at bay. They
    never rest, only consume.


    Truthfully,

    X'
