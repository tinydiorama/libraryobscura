    I hope that this letter reaches you. I''m sorry for the
    way I''ve written to you recently. I can''t help but feel hopeless sometimes.
    But believe me, your plants do give me the smallest hope. They ease the suffering,
    if only for a time.


    Please accept my apology and this key. I''ve kept it
    always on a cord around my neck but... something tells me you need more than
    I.


    Beseechingly,

    X'
