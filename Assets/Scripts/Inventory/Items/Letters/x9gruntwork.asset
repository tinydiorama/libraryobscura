  body: 'I have been formally disciplined, along with the rest of the Infirmary staff.
    According to the Vicars, we are "non-pious." All they keep repeating is that
    the plague is a matter of faith.


    They said we must cleanse, pray, and treat
    everyone their way. All I''m able to do now is change bandages and bury the dead.
    I send you a small token in exchange for your help - another key, in the hopes
    it can help you.


    Defeatedly,

    X'
