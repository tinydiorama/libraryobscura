  body: ' It was chaos when I came off the wards today. Several of the Vicars stormed
    out of Father Octavius''s chambers, all the while shouting. It appears the Vicars
    are being formally investigated for "abandonment of duty." I also heard that
    two of the them have left for exile. What is happening?


    As my luck perhaps
    turns... so does yours. I have found another key in the confessionals. The keys
    are so cold - I know they must belong with the manor.


    Dazedly,

    X'
