  body: 'Another sleepless night. Perhaps the quiet of the night is making me sentimental.
    You see, I grew up here in the city. My father and mother made their fortunes
    trading rare and hard to acquire items. As a child, I did not want for anything.


    I
    see now that the pursuit of knowledge is the only pursuit that matters. What
    is the point of so many things and so much money?


    Boldly,

    A Friend'
