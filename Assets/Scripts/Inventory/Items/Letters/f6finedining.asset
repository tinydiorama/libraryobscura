  body: 'It seems to be harder to find supplies nowadays. Quills, paper, rare books,
    and even my favorite tea have all been in short supply. I had a meeting at my
    favorite teahouse with a close colleague and she is having similar problems.
    Simply incredible!


    But my meeting with her was fruitful - she came across
    this old book, and neither of us can read it. I suspect it might be another book
    for the manor.


    Quietly,

    A Friend'
