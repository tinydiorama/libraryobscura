  body: 'It happened. Father Octavius knocked on my door near midnight. He said that
    the treatments here at the Infirmary are unacceptable. He wouldn''t let me get
    a word in edgewise - no matter what I said, he would not be swayed.


    According
    to him, the plague is a matter of faith. Our herbal treatments are no longer
    allowed. I don''t know what to do... but... continue sending the plants anyway.
    For now.


    Forlornly,

    X'
