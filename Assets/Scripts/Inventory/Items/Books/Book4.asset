  page2: 'In compassionate memory of Saint Rose. Rose dedicated her life to caring
    and healing others. She first trained with the Church of  Consecration in caring
    for the sick. She developed practices such as washing wounds  with saltwater,
    boiling water for clean bandages, and using native herbs for treatment. Saint
    Rose''s commitment led her and her fellow nurses to establish their own hospital.


    Her
    profound impact on the community compelled the Church to canonize her posthumously
    as a Saint.'
