    I send you an appeal because we are running
    out of time. Upon where you stand, at that sacred and terrible library, can grow
    miraculous herbs. Take these seeds to the back garden, care for them, and return
    the grown plants to me. Don''t try to leave there: you''re fate-bound now. I''m
    sorry for this, but at least the Shades can''t touch you out there.


    Sincerely,

    X'
