  body: 'I am so excited to write to you! A thought came to me last night, when sleep
    wouldn''t.


    I have a working theory: it has to do with the books. They yearn
    for the house, like iron filings to magnets. It is only at the house that you
    are able to read the books I cannot. The link between these books and the house
    may be the answer to the secrets the manor holds...


    Spellbound,

    A
    Friend'
