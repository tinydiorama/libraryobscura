  page2: 'Praised be the Brights, benevolent beings of light. They guided Humanity
    in its early days, nurturing and protecting us as we grew. As our cities developed,
    the Brights returned to their realm, observing from afar. Our Holy Church of
    Consecration was established to honor and grow the Brights'' vision for Humanity.


    Our
    Church is our community. Your esteemed Vicars are mere servants. Together we
    tell the sacred journey of the Brights and Humanity. Come and join our Holy Assemblies
    that are held every seventh day. Together we will commit and affirm our dedication
    before the Brights.'
