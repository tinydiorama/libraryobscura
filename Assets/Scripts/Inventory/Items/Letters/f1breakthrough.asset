  body: 'How does this letter find you? What do you see, there in the manor? What
    shadows pass in the night? I have so many questions - how I wish we could trade
    places!


    My breakthrough came last night. I found another book hidden away
    in the darkest market stall. The letters seem to shift when I try to read it.
    May it help you in your trials.


    Kindly,

    A Friend'
