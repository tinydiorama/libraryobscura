  body: 'My brother Bartholomew visited me for the first time in years. He said the
    plague has worsened, and he felt he would be safer in the city''s heart. I feel
    strangely uncertain. My brother is worldly and well traveled. If he is concerned,
    it is real.


    My dreams have been frenzied whisperings still.


    Sleeplessly,

    A
    Friend'
