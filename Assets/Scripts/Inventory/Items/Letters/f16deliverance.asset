  body: 'Midnight at last! It has all become so clear now. I understand everything;
    the darkness IS the answer. The books, the Plague, and even the Seven Brights
    cannot know everything. Do you see? Do you understand?


    Give me the Panacea
    of Binding, and we can stop the plague, and you can finally leave that cursed
    place! Nothing can stop us, not even the Brights!


    Enlightened,

    A Friend'
