  page2: 'What if we''re wrong? What if the Church''s interpretation of the Brights
    is overconfident? Perhaps there is more to the Brights than any of us could ever
    understand. In my studies of firsthand accounts of those who dealt with the Brights,
    there appears to be no evidence that they comprehend us as we think we comprehend
    them.


    What if our understanding of the Brights, who we trust above all
    else, have a hidden duality that could spell our doom?'
