  body: 'Father Octavius continues to be my shadow. I treated a particularly afflicted
    victim today, and I applied some of your herbs. The herbs cause pain at the beginning,
    but soon the patient eases into a deep, restful sleep. This way, the shadows
    lessen.


    Only... Octavius asked how it worked. I did my best to answer,
    but he was not pleased. This is very bad.


    Stunned,

    X'
