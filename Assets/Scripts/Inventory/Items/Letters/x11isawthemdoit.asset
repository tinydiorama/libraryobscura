  body: "News has indicated that the plague has slowed down across the city. But
    then why is it still worse in the slums? I traveled across the city to visit
    a friend, and saw that the plague shelters were gone. \n\nIt was late at night
    when I returned home. I saw the priests were removing supplies from a plague
    ward and carrying them away into the night. Something is happening... and they
    are guilty.\n\nResigned,\nX"
