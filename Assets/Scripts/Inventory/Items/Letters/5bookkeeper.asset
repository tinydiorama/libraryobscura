    It fills me with hope that someone is at the library!
    It''s wondrous work that you''re doing. Have you had any luck with that troublesome
    book?


    In my studies, I''ve found many different curious artifacts. Some
    are helpful and others are terrifying. I found this key. I pass it to you now.
    I''ve kept it in my pocket, but it''s still ice-cold

    to the touch. Stay
    the course!


    Kindly,

    A Friend'
