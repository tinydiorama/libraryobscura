  page2: 'Some say that The Manor is older than the Shadowed Forest itself. Since
    time immemorial, the Manor has been where the veil between the Brights and the
    mortal world is at its thinnest. Through the Altar, one may become Bound and
    commune directly with the Brights.


    Is it possible that the Brights affect
    our world through sacrifice? Can the Manor grounds hold such a power?'
