    It worked, at least for a time. The plant
    you sent healed someone. It took away a measure of their consuming shadow. Out
    here, there is so much darkness. Even at high noon, the Shades'' presence is
    everywhere. I need more plants to continue the work.


    Yours respectfully,

    X'
