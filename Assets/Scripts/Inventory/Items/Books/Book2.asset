  page2: 'We all know that the Seven Brights began at the dawn of time. They began
    just like the Earth, they elementally manifested as holders, splinters, and melders.
    As Creation grew, it became aware and consciousness spread. The Brights absorbed
    these new aspects into their selves as well.


    Eventually, Humanity emerged
    and was nurtured by the Brights and their heralds. In our harmonies, we developed
    strength, kindness, and compassion.


    We all ask now, are the Brights still
    among us?'
