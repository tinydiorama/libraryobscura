  body: 'The Church of Consecration have been increasingly present with the plague.
    They''ve come to Saint Rose, our infirmary and house of rest, saying they''re
    here to help. I don''t believe a word of it. I never believed any of their nonsense
    growing up, though I''d never tell them that. The Church is not an ally, for
    us or anyone. Remember this always.


    Carefully,

    X'
