    Did you plant the seeds and care for them? Remember,
    you must send them to me when they''re grown. Without water, they''ll become
    ash.


    Here are two more seeds - it''s all I''ve got for now - and what little
    money I have. I''ll try to keep you stocked with money and seeds as I can.


    Remember:
    send me the plants!

    X'
