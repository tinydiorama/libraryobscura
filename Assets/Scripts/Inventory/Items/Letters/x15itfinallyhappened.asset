  body: "My friend,\n\nI write to you with sad news. This morning when I woke, I
    knew there was something deeply, viscerally wrong. I could barely move, and I
    was burning up, as if on fire. It was the worst fever I have ever had. With all
    my time on the wards, I almost thought I was immune. \n\nBut no. The Plague has
    come for me.\n\nLanguidly,\nX"
