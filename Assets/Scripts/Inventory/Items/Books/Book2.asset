  page2: 'The Seven Brights were said to be present moments after the very beginning.
    They began as elemental forces: holders, splinters, and melders with each other
    and all creation.


    As willpower and consciousness developed over time, so
    did the Brights take this into themselves. Humanity and the Brights moved together,
    wills united as one. Each one reflected the other with kindnesses, strengths,
    and certain weaknesses.'
