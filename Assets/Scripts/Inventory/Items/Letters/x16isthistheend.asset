  body: 'My dearest friend,


    Thoughts are slow to come now. I feel like lead,
    in thought and form. My fever is gone, and I know all too well that it is the
    beginning of the end. I realize now the Plague is an affliction of body, mind,
    and spirit.


    The only thing that can stop the plague is the Panacea of Binding,
    the strongest and most powerful herb. If you send it to me, perhaps I can save
    even myself, and all of us.


    Yours,

    X'
