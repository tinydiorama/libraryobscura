  body: 'Thank you again for your continued correspondence. Together we''ll unravel
    all of the manor''s mysteries, inch by inch and page by page!


    I have been
    researching the forbidden grounds of the manor for years, ever since I learned
    of it. To think, there could be a place where dreams and nightmares can come
    true. I cannot think of a more fascinating place. If only I were as brave as
    you, to set foot in that place!


    Kindly,

    A Friend'
