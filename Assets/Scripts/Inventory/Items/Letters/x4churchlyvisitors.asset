  body: 'The Church of Consecration have been nosying about Saint Rose, our infirmary,
    recently. They say they''re here to help, but I don''t believe a word of it.
    I tremble even putting these words to paper... I could be killed if this letter
    were intercepted.


    The Church is not an ally, for us or anyone. Remember
    this always.


    Carefully,

    X'
