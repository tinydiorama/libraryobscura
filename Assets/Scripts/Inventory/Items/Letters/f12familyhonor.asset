  body: 'All these thoughts about my brother and our parents have left me feeling
    nostalgic. Although my parents and I still exchange letters, I have not heard
    from them often over the past few years.


    Our relationship... it''s tense.
    I know they wonder what I''m even doing with my education. I must prove to them
    - the books hold the answer, I''m sure of it!


    Ambitiously,

    A Friend'
