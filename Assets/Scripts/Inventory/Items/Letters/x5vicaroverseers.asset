  body: "My clinic is no longer my own. It now belongs to the Church. It has ordained
    that our humble hospital would benefit from holy words from the Brights, and
    so they have sent five - five! - of their Vicars to \"observe and support.\"\n\nThey
    say we should continue our duties of caring, healing, and burying and that they
    are simply here to observe. But... I confess I worry for what will happen next.
    \n\nRespectfully,\nX"
