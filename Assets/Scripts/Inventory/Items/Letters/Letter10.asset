    I hope that this letter reaches you. I''m sorry for the
    way I''ve written to you recently. I can''t help but feel hopeless sometimes.
    Your plants give me the smallest hope. They help for a time, but they''re just
    never enough. Still, we must do what we can.


    Just know that every plant
    you send saves another life. Please send more varieties. It''s the only choice
    we''ve got.


    Beseechingly,

    X'
