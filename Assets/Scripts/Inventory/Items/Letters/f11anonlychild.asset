  body: 'My brother, Bartholomew, often speaks of the love between us and among our
    family. He speaks of how our family is favored by the Brights. I cannot find
    fault with what he says... but why do I feel a sinking thought in my heart?


    He
    was the golden boy, with all his treats and tricks, his lovers and his myrth-oils.
    Those who have gone to prison for him, who have rotted for him. What can it be
    like to be an only child?


    Longingly,

    A Friend'
