  body: 'Last night I dreamt about the Church, its spires engulfed in the fires of
    my rage. The Vicars do not want to cure the plague. For them, the Faith is the
    only truth. They only care about their Faith and upholding their power.


    I
    hardly dare write this, but what if they are spreading the Plague? They may be
    traitors among us.


    Conspiratorially,

    X'
