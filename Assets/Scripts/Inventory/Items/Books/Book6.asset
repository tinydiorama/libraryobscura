  page2: 'We have studied the ancient texts for so long that actually meeting one
    of the Brights was... a shock. Father Julius recognized it as the Bright of Compassion.
    When it approached the makeshift grave we had dug for Father Henrick, we all
    drew a breath. But as Father Henrick lived again, the Bright took the life from
    our manservant in exchange.


    It is paradoxical that an entity of Compassion
    would demand such an exchange or sacrifice! There is a shadow of Cruelty in this
    act. But... even writing this is heresy, I know. I must hide this journal!'
