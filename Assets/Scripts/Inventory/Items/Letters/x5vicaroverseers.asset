  body: 'My clinic is no longer my own, it belongs to the Church. The Church ordained
    that our humble hospital would benefit from holy words from the Brights. Five,
    five of their Vicars have been sent to Saint Rose to "observe and support." They
    say all of us should continue our duties of caring, healing, and burying. Watch
    the Vicars closely.


    Respectfully,

    X'
