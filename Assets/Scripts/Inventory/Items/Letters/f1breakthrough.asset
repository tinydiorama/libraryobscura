    How does this letter find you? I hope you''ve adjusted
    to the library and your new duties. What do you see, there in the library? What
    shadows pass in the night?


    My breakthrough came last night. I found another
    book hidden away in the darkest night. The letters seem to shift when I try to
    read it. May it help you in your trials.


    Kindly,

    A friend'
