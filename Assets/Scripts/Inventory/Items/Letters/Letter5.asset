  body: 'The darkness spreads,


    The plants only stem the tide, inch by painful
    inch. One person saved and then two more afflicted. The Shades grow.


    It''s
    a plague. I don''t know exactly how it spreads. It has something to do with all
    these growing Shades. They walk and people are exposed everywhere. There has
    to be a better way before it''s too late.


    Sincerely,

    X'
