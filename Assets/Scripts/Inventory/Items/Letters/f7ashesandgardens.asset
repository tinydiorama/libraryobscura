  body: 'Have you noticed the ash falling from the sky? I saw it today when I was
    watering my rooftop garden. In the morning, at first light, there was a layer
    of black film on the leaves. I swept up it all up and looked closer. It looked
    like ash from a fire! Why would there be ash falling from the sky? The wind has
    a strange sickly sweet smell.


    Bewilderedly,

    A Friend'
