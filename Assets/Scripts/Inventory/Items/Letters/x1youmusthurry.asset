    I had to bury more patients today. Do you know what
    that''s like? To hold a dying person in your arms, to feel their breath leave
    them? You must send more herbs! You must work more quickly!


    I beg of you
    - what you''ve done isn''t enough. Hurry! Send more herbs!


    Regards,

    X'
