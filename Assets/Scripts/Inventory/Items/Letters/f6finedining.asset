  body: 'Things seem to be harder to find nowadays. Quills, writing supplies, rare
    books, and even my favorite tea have all been in short supply. I had a meeting
    at my favorite teahouse with a close colleague and they were out of several items.
    Simply incredible! My colleague had found what I asked them to look for. I now
    pass this key to you.


    Quietly,

    A Friend'
