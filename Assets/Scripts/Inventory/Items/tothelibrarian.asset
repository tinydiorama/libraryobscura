    I''m writing to you to both warn you to stay
    away from this place, and to beg you to help me. I''ll put it plainly - the library
    is haunted. But inside its corridors holds great secrets, if you can unlock them.
    If you choose to stay, then please: tend to the garden in the yard. The plants
    there will help both of us. If you send them to me, I''ll try to send you things
    that will help you, too.


    Sincerely,

    A friend'
