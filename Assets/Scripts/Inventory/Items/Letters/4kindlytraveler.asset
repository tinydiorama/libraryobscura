    Greetings from the city! I was out walking
    and saw lights from inside the forest. Is there anyone there? I heard strange
    tales about that place as a child - I dream of its halls. In my endless research,
    I happened on this ancient tome. It seems to concern that place. I''ve tried
    and tried to determine what it says - all to no success. If I''m right, it may
    serve you better, there in that manor. If I can help in any way, please let me
    know.


    Warmly,

    A Friend'
