  body: 'I cannot hear myself think anymore. The tendrils feel like flames now; my
    mind is on fire. I have never felt more alive, have never felt closer to an epiphany
    than I do now.


    Sleep has been elusive for days. There are only the pages
    and the voices now. My mind is breaking, but soon I shall understand.


    Feverishly,

    A
    Friend'
