  body: 'The strangest letter arrived yesterday, a missive from my parents inquiring
    about my health, my research, and my brother. It brought me some peace.


    One
    of my colleagues, who assisted me in acquiring the Books, has invited me to join
    their research team at the University. Together, we are working on a cure for
    the plague. Your gift will push our research to incredible heights!  I finally
    feel focused and imbued with purpose.


    Hopefully,

    A Friend'
