  body: 'Thank you kindly for the return letters! It is simply splendid that the
    books I have sent were delivered and have been of use to you.


    I admit,
    I look forward to letters from you every day. Both the mystery of the manor and
    my concern for you in that place keep sleep at bay. It has been several nights
    since I was able to last rest... but I will send you more helpful tidings as
    I find them, you can count on me!


    Kindly,

    A Friend'
