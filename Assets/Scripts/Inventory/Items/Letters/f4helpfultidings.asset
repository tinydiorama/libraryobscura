  body: 'Thank you kindly for the return letters! It is simply splendid that the
    books I have sent were delivered and have been of use to you. At first I had
    been worried, today it seems that sometimes deliveries are unreliable. The courier
    I have found is most resourceful it would seem. So far, I have not been able
    to read the books. If you find out anything, please share it!


    Kindly,

    A
    Friend'
