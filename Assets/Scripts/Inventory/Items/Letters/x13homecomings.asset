  body: "Father Octavius asked me to come to his chambers after morning prayers.
    I am to be reinstated as a ward physician! I cannot believe it! He said my penance
    had been genuine (I did suffer) and my prayers earnest (no chance!). \n\nSmall
    favors indeed! Octavius also led a Sanctity ritual with the remaining Vicars
    to cleanse the ward. The timing could not be better - the plague is strengthening
    again.\n\nHopefully,\nX"
