  body: 'I hope your studies have progressed with these confounding books! We have
    not exchanged many pleasantries so far. I grew up in the city and was fortunate
    enough to be born to a wealthy trading family. They made their fortunes trading
    rare and hard to acquire items. As a child, I did not want for anything but I
    did try to keep an open mind. I want to change the world!


    Boldly,

    A
    Friend'
