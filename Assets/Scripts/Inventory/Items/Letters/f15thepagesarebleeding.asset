  body: 'It came darkly. The whispers stopped and grew. Strange bedfellows, these
    pages. I watched until the ink bled. It welled up in drops and became a dark
    torrent. Darkness spread, the ink was still black. It was everywhere. Everything
    was gone. Ink-like blood was all. Now, we see.


    Maddeningly,

    A Friend'
