  body: 'My brother left this morning after he found an inn near the city center.
    I admit... I am a bit relieved to see him go. I continue to search for these
    books in every place imaginable. It is difficult now - there are plague victims
    all over the city. The funeral pyres continue to rain ash upon us nightly.


    Take
    this new book, with my eternal friendship.


    Silently,

    A Friend'
