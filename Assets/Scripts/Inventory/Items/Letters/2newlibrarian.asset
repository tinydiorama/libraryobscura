    Time for you is stretched, but for us it dwindles
    each day. Did you plant the seeds and care for them? Remember, you must send
    them to me when you''ve grown them. Without water, they''ll become ash. Here
    are two more seeds - it''s all I''ve got for now. If you can raise drobles, I
    may be able to get more seeds. I''ve sent you what little I have.


    I''ll
    send another letter soon. Until later...

    X'
