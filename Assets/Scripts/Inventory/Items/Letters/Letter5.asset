    It fills me with hope that someone is at
    the library! It''s wondrous work that you''re doing. Hopefully the key I sent
    has been helpful.


    I''ve been researching the library for years, and I''m
    finally close to a breakthrough. I''ll send it along soon. Stay the course!


    Kindly,

    A
