  body: 'Your miracle has saved us all. With the Panacea of Binding, I have been
    cured. I am going to use it to heal any plague suffers who dwell in the City.


    Despite
    its power, the plague still spreads and smolders. The doors of Saint Rose remain
    open thanks to you.


    Gratefully,

    X'
