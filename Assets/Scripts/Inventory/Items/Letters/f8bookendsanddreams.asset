  body: 'I admit to you I have been struggling to find you more books - it is difficult
    to know where to go. On the streets now there are strange people who are sickly,
    like ghosts. I hardly know what to make of it.


    But at long last I have
    found you something new. Letter after letter, an endless barrage of opened missives.
    Then it finally came. The book is here.


    Sleep comes to me now... but these
    dreams are so strange.


    Ponderingly,

    A Friend'
