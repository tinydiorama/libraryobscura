  page2: 'The Brights walked closely with Humanity until the first cities were built.
    With time, the Brights stepped back and watched Humanity grow. In this distance,
    the Church of Consecration was formed to venerate the Brights.


    The Church
    and its Vicars were charged with recording how the Brights and Humanity walked
    together. The Vicars wrote the histories, spread the Word, and asked only for
    all to listen.'
