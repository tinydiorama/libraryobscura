  body: 'In research, scholars always dig deep to try to find the answers. That is
    what I''m doing for the house you are in.


    I have a working theory: it has
    to do with the books. They yearn for the house, like iron filings to magnets.
    Only at the house, you are able to read the books I cannot. The link between
    these books and the house may be the answer...


    Spellbound,

    A Friend'
